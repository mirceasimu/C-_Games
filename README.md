# C#_Games
A few small C# projects that I worked on during high school. These projects consist of different games, like a maze, TicTacToe, a difference-spotting game and so on. Plus there also is a simple calculator present.

You can find the .exe file for every project in "Project_Folder/bin/Debug/Project.exe"
