# C#_Games
A few small C# projects that I worked on during high school. These projects consist of different games, like a maze, TicTacToe, a difference-spotting game and so on. Plus there also is a simple calculator present.
Every variable, button, name and so on is in romanian, since that was easier for me at the time to work with.

You can find the .exe file for every project in "Project_Folder/bin/Debug/Project.exe"
